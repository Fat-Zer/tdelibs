/**

 * @short Generic configuration dialog that even works over component boundaries
 *
 * For more information see \ref KSettings.
 *
 * This class aims to standardize the use of configuration dialogs in KDE
 * applications. Especially when using KParts and/or Plugins you face problems
 * creating a consistent config dialog.
 *
 * To show a configuration dialog you only have to call the show method and be
 * done with it. A code example:
 *
 * You initialize \p m_cfgdlg with
 * \code
 * m_cfgdlg = new Dialog( Dialog::Static, this );
 * \endcode
 * If you use a KPart that was not especially designed for your app you can use
 * the second constructor:
 * \code
 * TQStringList kpartslist;
 * for( all my kparts )
 *   kpartslist += m_mypart->instance().instanceName();
 * m_cfgdlg = new Dialog( kpartslist, this );
 * \endcode
 * and the action for the config dialog is connected to the show slot:
 * \code
 * KStdAction::preferences( m_cfgdlg, TQT_SLOT( show() ), actionCollection() );
 * \endcode
 *
 * If you need to be informed when the config was changed and applied in the
 * dialog you might want to take a look at Dispatcher.
 *
 * For more information see \ref KSettings.
