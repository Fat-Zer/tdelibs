 * @short A class to split a pixmap into several items.
 *
 * If you have a pixmap containing several items (icons), you can use this
 * class to get the coordinates of each item.
 *
 * For example, if you have a pixmap with 25 items and you want to get the
 * 4th item as a pixmap (every item being 20x10 pixels):
 * \code
 * KPixmapSplitter splitter;
 * splitter.setPixmap( somePixmap );
 * splitter.setItemSize( TQSize( 20, 10 ));
 *
 * TQPixmap item( 20, 10 );
 * item.fill( Qt::white );
 * TQRect rect = splitter.coordinates( 4 );
 * if ( !rect.isEmpty() )
 *     bitBlt( &item, TQPoint(0,0), &somePixmap, rect, CopyROP );
 * \endcode
