/**
 * @short Standard "About KDE" dialog box
 *
 * This is a widget used to display animation using multiple
 * individual pixmaps.  This widget allows you to deal with variable
 * size icons (e.g., ones that will change based on a global setting)
 * as it loads the icons internally.  All you need to do is pass along
 * a list of icon names and their size and everything else is taken
 * care of.
 *
 * This widget also emits a 'clicked()' signal when it received a
 * mouse press event.
 *
 * A quick example:
 * \code
 * KAnimWidget *anim = new KAnimWidget("kde", 0, this);
 * anim->start();
 * \endcode
 *
 * That example will search for the pixmaps "one.png", "two.png", and
 * "three.png" in the share/icons/small/ directories as well as the
 * app's pics directory.
