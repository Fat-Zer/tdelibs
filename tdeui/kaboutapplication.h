 * @short Standard "About Application" dialog box.

 * This class provides the standard "About Application" dialog box
 * that is used by KHelpMenu. It uses the information of the global
 * TDEAboutData that is specified at the start of your program in
 * main(). Normally you should not use this class directly but rather
 * the KHelpMenu class or even better just subclass your toplevel
 * window from TDEMainWindow. If you do the latter, the help menu and
 * thereby this dialog box is available through the
 * TDEMainWindow::helpMenu() function.
