There should be at least two libs:
1. kdemm(core)
==============

Provides the wrapper for the media framework and all needed media functionality.
Whether this lib needs to depend on kdeui? Depends on how we could handle video
without UI... but if possible we should put the video-widget in kdemmwidgets.

The Requirements & Specification document can be found in reqspec.html


2. kdemmwidgets
===============

Provides convenience widgets for the common widgets that are needed:
- Position slider (display position and move it to seek)
- Volume fader
- Effects dialog (including EQ)
- Video widget
- Player controls as toolbar


Also there could be a KPart:
3. kdemmpart
============

A KPart implementing the KMediaPlayer interface.
