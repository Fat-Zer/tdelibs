   * Net Transparency.
   *
   * NetAccess allows you to do simple file operation (load, save,
   * copy, delete...) without working with TDEIO::Job directly.
   * Whereas a TDEIO::Job is asynchronous, meaning that the
   * developer has to connect slots for it, TDEIO::NetAccess provides
   * synchronous downloads and uploads, as well as temporary file
   * creation and removal. The functions appear to be blocking,
   * but the Qt event loop continues running while the operations
   * are handled. This means that the GUI will not freeze.
   *
   * This class isn't meant to be used as a class but only as a simple
   * namespace for static functions, though an instance of the class
   * is built for internal purposes.
   *
   * Port to tdeio done by David Faure, faure@kde.org
   *
   * @short Provides an easy, synchronous interface to TDEIO file operations.

     * Downloads a file from an arbitrary URL (@p src) to a
     * temporary file on the local filesystem (@p target).
     *
     * If the argument
     * for @p target is an empty string, download will generate a
     * unique temporary filename in /tmp. Since @p target is a reference
     * to TQString you can access this filename easily. Download will
     * return true if the download was successful, otherwise false.
     *
     * Special case:
     * If the URL is of kind file:, then no downloading is
     * processed but the full filename is returned in @p target.
     * That means you @em have to take care about the @p target argument.
     * (This is very easy to do, please see the example below.)
     *
     * Download is synchronous. That means you can use it like
     * this, (assuming @p u is a string which represents a URL and your
     * application has a loadFile() function):
     *
     * \code

     * } else {
     *   KMessageBox::error(this, TDEIO::NetAccess::lastErrorString() );
     * }
     * \endcode
     *
     * Of course, your user interface will still process exposure/repaint
     * events during the download.
