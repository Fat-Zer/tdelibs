# This files includes the default behavior for some specific debug areas
# This allows to leave the kdDebug* calls in the code, but still have them
# disabled for most users.
#
# This file will be installed as $TDEDIR/share/config/kdebugrc
#
# There are four levels of output: Info, Warn, Error and Fatal
# corresponding to kdDebug(), kdWarn(), kdError(), kdFatal()
#
# For every of them you can define a target by *Output=n
# using the following numbers:
#
#   0 = file
#   1 = message box
#   2 = shell (stderr)
#   3 = syslog
#   4 = off
#
# For file output you can give a filename by *Filename=<file>
# otherwise kdebug.dbg in the current directory is used.
#
# the Default section sets the destination there all output goes to unless 
# there will be explicitly specefied in apropriate area-number section.

[Default]
FatalOutput=1
ErrorOutput=2
WarnOutput=2
InfoOutput=4

# Example:
#
# For the debug area 100 you want output of debug messages
# to a file /var/log/dbg.log and error messages as message boxes.
# Additionally the program should abort on fatal errors.
#
# [100]
# InfoOutput=0
# InfoFilename=/var/log/dbg.log
# ErrorOutput=1
# AbortFatal=1
